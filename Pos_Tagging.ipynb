Today, the United Nations brings together 193 member countries. Along with its membership, the expectations from the organisation have also grown, said Modi in his virtual address at Ecosoc session. From the very beginning, India has actively supported the UN's development work and the Ecosoc. The first president of Ecosoc was an Indian. India also contributed to shaping the Ecosoc agenda,Modi added. Today, through our domestic efforts, we are again playing a salient role in achieving Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals. We are also supporting other developing countries in meeting their Sustainable Development Goals, Modi further said.\")"
